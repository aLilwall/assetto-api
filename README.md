# Python REST API Container Project

## Backup-as-a-Service for 3D Asset Storage in the Cloud

This project was developed to strengthen foundational skills in Python programming, implement a RESTful API using Flask, and gain hands-on experience with containerization and cloud deployment strategies.

## Cloud Services Integration

Throughout the development process, I acquired practical knowledge in deploying containerized applications using cloud infrastructure. Key learnings include:

- Building container images using Docker and Podman CLI tools
- Setting up a cloud-based container registry to publish and manage images
- Configuring a cloud container service to run containers from custom images
